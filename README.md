#  IEat (Interacting Enhancers and Targets)
We present a workflow derivative of [TargetFinder](https://github.com/shwhalen/targetfinder) (by Pollard Lab) as a case study for working with Epigenetic, Methylation, GRO-Seq data.

### Problem
Biologists are manually searching for enhancer promoter interacting pairs because it is [difficult]() to build a predictor specific to each experimental system. 

### Approach
![Minimal Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NCBI-Hackathons/enhancertargets/master/img/MinWorkflow.png)

### Use cases
 - Experimentalists with data that is similar to [MCF-7 cell line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7) can directly query our model [Here](list-of-interactions)
- Experimentalists looking to build their own model but who cannot meet provide the data demanded by other methods can follow our minimalist approach

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/enhancertargets.git
cd enhancertargets 
docker build . -t enhancer
docker run -it -v `pwd`:/data enhancer
```
### Data Preparation
Run `./generate_region.sh`

### Machine Learning
