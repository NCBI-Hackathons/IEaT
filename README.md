#  PIES (Promoter Interacting Enhancers Search)
A tool that combines Gro-Seq and Chip-Seq data to predict enhancer and promoter interactions. We present one workflow derivative of [TargetFinder](https://github.com/shwhalen/targetfinder) and [ChromHMM](http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/) as a searchable example.

### Problem
Biologists are manually searching for enhancer promoter interacting pairs because it is difficult to build a predictor specific to each experimental system.

### Approach
![Minimal Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NCBI-Hackathons/enhancertargets/master/img/MinWorkflow.png)

### Use cases
 - Experimentalists with data that is similar to [MCF-7 cell line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7) can directly query our model [Here](https://www.google.com)
- Experimentalists looking to build their own model but who cannot meet provide the data demanded by other methods can follow our minimalist approach

### Installation
1. Install Docker
2. docker run image
3. Run python generate_enhancer.py
4. Train
